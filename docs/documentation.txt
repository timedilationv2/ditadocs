DITA Docs for Automation & CI/CD
=================================

Overview:
This repository is designed to automate the build and deployment of DITA-based documentation using CI/CD. It leverages the DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT) to transform your DITA XML files into various output formats like HTML and PDF.

Features:
- Automatic build process using GitHub Actions.
- Simple, modular DITA content.
- Custom “Awesome DITA Theme” for a polished look.

How to Build:
1. Ensure DITA-OT is installed.
2. Run the build script:
   ./build.sh
3. Check the output in the 'output' folder.

For more details, please refer to the DITA map (docs/main.ditamap) and topic files (docs/introduction.dita).
