## Understanding This Repository

This repository demonstrates how to build a structured **DITA-based documentation system** combined with Markdown, GitHub Actions, and GitHub Pages.  
It showcases modular XML authoring with modern CI/CD and static site generation.

## What is DITA?

Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an XML-based architecture for creating, managing, and publishing modular technical content.  
It is commonly used in enterprise documentation and technical manuals.

**Key Characteristics:**

| Feature                  | Description                                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic-based Authoring    | Breaks content into modular units (task, concept, etc.) |
| Reuse & Inheritance      | Enables shared components across documents              |
| Conditional Publishing   | Customize content for different audiences or outputs    |
| Multi-format Output      | HTML, PDF, ePub, and others                             |

## Markdown Use Cases

Markdown is used throughout this repo for lightweight content such as:

| Use Case         | Why Markdown?                                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`      | Quick, readable intro with GitHub rendering support |
| GitHub Wiki      | Clean formatting, fast edits, inline linking        |
| Jekyll Support   | Works natively in GitHub Pages static site builds   |

Markdown is best suited for **developer-facing content** or **lighter documentation** that doesn't require complex output or reuse structures.|
